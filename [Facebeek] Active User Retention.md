# üìä SQL Query: Monthly Active Users (MAUs) for July 2022

## üìù Problem Statement

Assume you're given a table containing information on Facebook user actions. Write a query to obtain the number of **monthly active users (MAUs)** in **July 2022**, including the **month in numerical format** (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, ...).

### üí° Hint:
An **active user** is defined as a user who has performed actions such as `'sign-in'`, `'like'`, or `'comment'` **in both the current month and the previous month**.

## üìò Table: `user_actions`

| Column Name | Type     | Description                               |
|-------------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `user_id`   | integer  | ID of the user                            |
| `event_id`  | integer  | ID of the event                           |
| `event_type`| string   | Type of event: `"sign-in"`, `"like"`, `"comment"` |
| `event_date`| datetime | Timestamp of the event                    |

---

## üì• Example Input (`user_actions`)

| user_id | event_id | event_type | event_date          |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| 445     | 7765     | sign-in     | 2022-05-31 12:00:00 |
| 742     | 6458     | sign-in     | 2022-06-03 12:00:00 |
| 445     | 3634     | like        | 2022-06-05 12:00:00 |
| 742     | 1374     | comment     | 2022-06-05 12:00:00 |
| 648     | 3124     | like        | 2022-06-18 12:00:00 |

## üì§ Example Output (for June 2022)

| month | monthly_active_users |
|--------|-----------------------|
| 6      | 1                     |

### Explanation:
In **June 2022**, there was only one monthly active user (`user_id = 445`) who had activity in **both** May and June.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please adapt your solution to calculate MAUs for **July 2022**.

## üß† Goal:
- Write a SQL query to determine the number of **monthly active users in July 2022**.
- Ensure output includes:
  - `month`: numerical value (e.g., `7`)
  - `monthly_active_users`: count of distinct active users meeting the criteria
