### ðŸ§  Explanation:

- User **123** made **2 purchases** on **07/08/2022** â†’ most recent = 07/08
- User **115** made **1 purchase** on **07/08/2022**
- User **159** had 2 transactions, but their **most recent** was on **07/10/2022**, so we count only that purchase.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output â€“ this is just an example!

``` sql

with cte1 as (
select product_id,user_id,spend,transaction_date, RANK() over(partition by user_id order by transaction_date desc ) as rnk
from user_transactions )

select transaction_date,user_id,count(product_id) as purchase_count from cte1 where rnk=1 group by 1,2 order by 1;
